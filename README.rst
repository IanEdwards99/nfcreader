Python API for CR95HF NFC reader to run on the Pi Zero. Used as a python wrapper for the existing C API provided for the CR95HF module by STMicroelectronics. However, it was found to be lacking for Linux users, as well as difficult to compile and run compared to a Python API.

Abstract
--------
Use case scenario for demonstrator application: Student access to venues.
The aim was to provide better support for the CR95HF's use for the Raspberry Pi in Python3, via an API.
A demonstrator application was created for showing the uses of the API for an access control use case: https://github.com/IanEdwards99/CR95HF_Demo_App

Features
--------
- USB Connect
- Protocol Select
- Send Receive
- ResetSPI
- Field Off
- Send IRQ Pulse
- Send NSS Pulse
- STCmd Command
- Initiate
- ResetToReady
- MCUrev
- Echo
- Idn (Get ID number of CR95HF module)
- GetPinInterfaceState
- Reading from NFC tag
- Writing to NFC tag
- IDLE for tag
- Scan and Write
- Tag detection and hunting
- Clearing NFC tag
- Read entire contents of all registers from tag
- Extract payload
- Prepare for writing and reading with dec/hex/string conversion functions.

Installation
------------
pip install the file from PyUp, or clone this git repo and "make install".
It is important to install 3 dependancies to use the CR95HF with its C library and development board:

- "sudo apt-get install build-essential"
- "sudo apt-get install g++"
- "sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev"
- Navigate to ./nfcreader/nfcreader/src and run "make" to compile a libCR95HF.so file for your current architecture.

Lastly, add libCR95HF.so, found in the src folder, to your environment variable. If your program still fails, copy it to your /lib and /usr/lib folders in your root directory.
